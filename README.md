## Project Overview

The Unemployment Analysis project aims to provide a detailed examination of unemployment rates over time. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of results. The primary tool used for this analysis is the Jupyter Notebook.
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.
The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s unemployment rate during Covid-19. So let’s start the task of Unemployment analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from reliable databases, which include but are not limited to:
- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
- World Bank
- National statistical agencies

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Unemployment_Analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Unemployment_Analysis
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb
    ```

5. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis.
